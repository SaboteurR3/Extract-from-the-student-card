I wrote a class Employee with the following fields: first name, last name, Id, date of birth, age (calculate by date of birth), salary, rating.
I placed several Employee class objects in the ArrayList and sorted with IComparer method:
A) decreasing according to the employee rating;
B) increasing according to the employee's salary;
C) increasing according to the age of the employee;
